"Research Question #4: Which file extensions are most frequently and least frequently archived?(.exe, .jar, everything, etc.)"
Note: 
"When analyzing 200 Jenkinsfiles, there are many extension types which occur less than 3% of the time."
"Here is the list of those extensions: .ini, .json, .xml, .sh, .tar.gz, .*, .html, .hpi, .a, .yml, .pdf, .whl, .csv, .gz, .deb, .exe, .ttl, .1.0.jar, .aar, .so, .tbz, .iso, .scmp, .rpm, .out, .0.1.jar, .h, .hex, .msi"
"To prevent these from overshadowing other prominent extension types, they were grouped into one extension labeled Other,"
"and their occurrences were averaged. You will see this in the first table below. To see them ungrouped, look at the 2nd table below."
